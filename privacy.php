        <h4>What data do we collect and store?</h4>
        <p>
            When you register with TruckersDB, we collect your email address, chosen password and username/display name in order to create your account. While we ask for your month/year of birth at the time of registration, this data is not stored, and is used solely to ensure that all users are at least 13 years of age.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've registered, all other information you provide, such as links to accounts on other services or information about a company you create, is optional but recommended, as it allows us to provide you with all the features available on our platform. The information you provide, unless explicitly stated, will be accessible to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some information is collected automatically when possible, such as hours played or delivery history. This information will often be gathered from our own platform/software, but may be collected from external services where it is available. This kind of data is mainly used to generate statistics about you and your company.
        </p>
        <h4>What do we do with this data?</h4>
        <p>
            All information provided or otherwise collected is solely used to provide you with the best possible service on our platform. The data we store will be used to create and maintain your account/company, generate statistics, keep track of your hours played and recent deliveries, provide you with recommendations for companies that may suit you, and award you with achievements. We don't collect anything that we don't have a reasonable use for.
        </p>
        <h5>Third Parties</h5>
        <p>
            Sometimes, we may need to share data with select third parties so that we can provide you with access to all features of our platform. These third parties also follow strict privacy rules, and we will only share and receive data that you have already agreed to, such as a unique identifier for each service, or your public profile information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, we only share and receive data from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://truckersmp.com/policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TruckersMP</a> - you can click the names of each service to view their own privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h4>How long do we store your data?</h4>
        <p>
            We never store your data for longer than we need it. Your information is stored until you remove your account, or after one year of account inactivity. Company data is stored until the company is deleted or the owner's account is removed. You can remove your account in your account settings, and you can delete your company in the company settings, provided that you are the owner of the company.
        </p>
